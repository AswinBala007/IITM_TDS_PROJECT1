# GitHub User and Repository Scraping in Zurich

- I used the GitHub API to collect detailed data on Zurich-based users with over 50 followers and their most recent public repositories, processing and storing it in structured CSV files.
- The most surprising insight was that **a significant portion of Zurich developers actively contribute to open-source projects in diverse languages, yet a high percentage lack licenses in their repositories**.
- Based on this data, **I recommend developers add clear licensing to their repositories to enhance project credibility and usability for collaborators**.

## Project Overview

This project involves scraping data on active GitHub users in Zurich who have a minimum of 50 followers, along with information about their recent public repositories. The objective is to store user and repository data in two structured CSV files, `users.csv` and `repositories.csv`, while cleaning and standardizing fields for consistent data analysis.

### Data Collection Process

1. **User Data:** For each eligible user (over 50 followers), we captured details such as `login`, `name`, `company`, `location`, `email`, `hireable`, `bio`, `public_repos`, `followers`, `following`, and `created_at`.
   - **Company Data Cleaning**: All company names were stripped of leading whitespace, the `@` symbol (only the first occurrence), and converted to uppercase for consistency.
   
2. **Repository Data:** For each user, up to 500 of their most recently pushed public repositories were collected with fields: `login`, `full_name`, `created_at`, `stargazers_count`, `watchers_count`, `language`, `has_projects`, `has_wiki`, and `license_name`.
   
3. **Data Storage:** The data was stored in `users.csv` for user information and `repositories.csv` for repository details. Each file was designed to allow easy querying and analysis.

### Analysis and Findings

A high-level examination of the data uncovered trends and patterns among developers in Zurich:
- **Open Source Participation:** Many developers engage in open-source contributions, often using a variety of programming languages, suggesting a vibrant and diverse developer community in Zurich.
- **Licensing Practices:** An observation was made that a large percentage of repositories lack specified licenses, which could limit usage and discourage contributions from other developers.

### Recommendations

1. **License Your Code**: Adding a license to your repositories helps protect your work and encourages collaboration.
2. **Profile Visibility**: Developers may benefit from updating their profile with bio and company information, as it can enhance their professional presence.
3. **Project Setup**: Enabling projects and wikis in repositories can make it easier for collaborators to get involved and understand the projectâ€™s goals.

### Files in Repository

- **users.csv**: Contains user information with fields as specified in the project.
- **repositories.csv**: Contains up to 500 of the most recent repositories for each user.
